Keylime Documentation
=====================

Welcome to Keylimes Documentation site!

Keylime is a TPM based highly scaleable remote boot attestation and runtime
integrity measurement solution. Keylime enables cloud users to monitor remote
nodes using a hardware based cryptographic root of trust.

Keylime was originally born out of the security research team in MIT's Lincoln
Laboratory and is now developed and maintained by the Keylime community.

This Documentation site contains guides to install, use and administer keylime
as well as guides to enable developers to make contributions to keylime
or develop services against Keylimes Rest API(s).
